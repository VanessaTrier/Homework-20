  <h3 class="sectionHeading">User Research</h3>
  <p>The purpose of our research was to find out more about both who would be using the Brain Injury Alliance website; as well as figure out more about our stakeholder and what they saw as the primary goal of the website.
 </p>
 <hr class="my-4" />

<h3 class="subHeading">User Research Objectives</h3>
<p>Before starting our research, we made the assumption that our stakeholder valued donations as the primary goal of their website. With that, we posed the research questions of "How might we improve confidence in the Brain Injury Alliance to raise a sense of trust with the brand, and thereby increase repeat traffic and raise donations?"</p>
<ul>
  <li>What do users need to know to understand traumatic brain injuries?
  </li>
  <li>What motivates someone to donate to the cause?
  </li>
  <li>Conduct 5 second test to gauge current satisfaction with the website's homepage and navigation layout.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="subHeading">Methodology</h3>
<p>We started by conducting user interviews to answer our objectives. Proceeding our user interviews, we conducted a survey to gain further understanding into some initial insights from our user interviews.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Initial User Interviews: 5</li>
  <li>Total Surveyed: 50 People</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="subHeading">Analysis</h3>
  <p>After conducting our user interviews and survey, we synthesized all of our findings into an Affinity Diagram. From our Affinity Diagram, we pulled a few key insights from the users of the Brain Injury Alliance website that we were able to put into a User Persona, Debra. </p>

     <h3 class="heading sectionHeading">User Persona</h3>
      <p>Meet Debra, a 43 year old physical therapist from Minnesota.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<br>
  <h4>Wants and Needs</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Wants to feel she is making a difference in people’s lives.</li>
    <li>Wants to be personally contacted by an organization I have donated to or thinking about donating to</li>
    <li>Wants to know where the money I’ve donated is going and how it is helping others.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <h4>Pain Points and Concerns</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>I ended a relationship with an organization because they were unresponsive to me.</li>
    <li>Can be a people pleaser to others and has difficulty with confrontation face to face.</li>
    <li>“Do I get on the internet and scare myself about symptoms, yes.”</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <h4>Motivations</h4>
  <p>As a physical therapist, Debra knows many individuals impacted by TBIs. She likes to contribute to organizations that are showing her that they’re making a difference.
    Debra says things like:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>“I donate when I can see a positive impact”</li>
    <li>“I donate to causes that I care about”</li>
    <li>  “I donate because of a personal connection or because it makes an impact locally””</li>
  </ul>
<br><br>
  <h3 class="sectionHeading">The Stakeholder</h3>
<p>Before our Stakeholder Interview we were focusing on donations because it was not primary feature of the website. We assumed this would be important for the stakeholder and the user.

  However, after our stakeholder interview we learned donations are not a focus because they receive annual grants for their free direct care services. 
  
  Their primary focus was education about brain injuries and increasing awareness through their fundraising events. They feel  that the press they receive from the annual fundraising events is the most helpful in their mission of increasing awareness about brain injuries.  
  
  This feedback was very important and we were able to focus on Debra’s needs of feeling personally connected to an organization through attending an event and increasing accessibility and awareness about the event for the stakeholders needs.  And now to Jack.

<section class="research container contentSection">
 
  <h2 class="sectionHeading">Define</h2>
  <hr class="my-4" />
  <h3 class="sectionHeading">Problem Statement</h3>
  <p>Given the pivot in direction from the stakeholder interview, I also iterated our Problem statement to address the needs of the nonprofit itself: solely redesigning the site to streamline donations wasn’t viable enough. The events and volunteering would also bring the company the revenue it needed.
 </p>
 <p>The problem statement became:
  “The Brain Injury Alliance was designed to raise awareness and enhance the quality of life for all people affected by a brain injury. We have observed that people who donate to local organizations tend to spend ample time researching the organization first; and that the BIA website isn’t set up for easy browsing and pinpointing the content they are looking for. How might we allow individuals and their family members with a TBI who are already overwhelmed to easily find the information they are looking for on the BIA website.”</p>

<h3 class="sectionHeading">The Solution</h3>
<p>Focusing more on the volunteering process for the users, I went back to the user interviews and realized that we had the opportunity to encourage users to volunteer or participate more often by paying special attention to personal communication. Although some users expressed that they prefer not to have random emails from the nonprofits, they like to have a personal connection to someone involved. Our confirmation messages could be personalized, and we could have a facebook feed on the site itself, so users can see that they’re involved with a community they know and are a part of.
  Messages of gratitude, for example will help encourage returning volunteers. We designed several key features which would foster open, personal communication, and encourage outreach.
  An embedded Facebook feed would help users feel that the community is active, and that other individuals are taking part.
  Personalized emails from the organization will drive a sense of responsibility among volunteers.</p>

  <div class="affinityDiagram">
    <img src="1_PlCOMO9o4S8DXr43GUN1xw.png">
  </div>
  <p>Since what supports the organization is event publicity, attendance, and donations; and because users expressed they rarely trust an organization if they can’t understand it or see its impact, putting those subjects in the forefront of the information architecture goes a long way to the increasing volunteering and donations. For example, the current website has information relevant to their purpose, mission, and goals scattered throughout pages under the About Us section, but we would put all this information in the main “About Us” page, since it can all easily fit in one screen.</p>

<section class="research container contentSection">
 
  <h2 class="sectionHeading">Prototype & Test</h2>
  <hr class="my-4" />
  <h3 class="sectionHeading">Prototyping Process</h3>
  <p>To synthesize the user journey into a prototype, I started my sketching out the steps in Debra’s journey online at the Brain Injury Alliance website.  
 </p>

 <div class="affinityDiagram">
  <img src="1_tELG6h_js5Udyeg-mxr5nw.png">
</div>

<p>Next, I turned my paper prototypes into digital prototypes through a quick wireframe process in Figma.
</p>

<div class="affinityDiagram">
  <img src="1_dBU6mwiUXuZN_NNF9E_hsw.png">
</div>
<p>After creating the first digital wireframe, it was my priority to user test the wireframe and see what issues users had with the initial layout.
  To test this first prototype, I needed to outline what I wanted to learn from users. The steps that users had to accomplish were:</p>
<ol>
<li>Where would you go to learn more about a Traumatic Brain Injury?</li>
<li>Your friend is doing the Walk for Thought. You want to go with them but you forgot when it is. Where would you go?
</li>
<li>Show me how you might get in touch with this organization</li>
<li>Where would you go to sign up to volunteer for an event?</li>
</ol>
<div class="affinityDiagram">
  <img src="1_gjH75eE6jMjiTFp2skvmHg.png">
</div>
<p>From the first user test, I learned that 100% were able to accomplish Tasks 1–3. However, only 33% were able to accomplish Task 4. With that, I needed to improve the process for volunteering for an event, and provide more ways for users to volunteer for events, since that’s a big priority for the organization.</p>
<h4>Mid Fidelity Prototype</h4>
<p>For the mid-fidelity prototype, I iterated the header navigation and added the new brand styling to all pages in the user flow.
</p>

<div class="affinityDiagram">
  <img src="1_bm6m6zlybE72yV5O5LtsyQ.png">
</div>
<h4>High Fidelity Prototype — The Final Result</h4>
<p>After user testing the mid-fidelity prototype, I created the final prototype that included 2 separate rounds of feedback. I iterated both desktop and mobile devices with the final edits.
</p>

<div class="affinityDiagram">

    <h2 class="sectionHeading">Next Steps</h2>
    <hr class="my-4" />
    <p>In following iterations, I will:  
   </p>
<ul>
<li>Interview actual users of the site</li>
<li>Build out search functionality in header navigation</li>
<li>Build out a flow for making a donation</li>
<li>Various usability tests and A/B tests on component types and positioning</li>
</ul>
